                <h1>My Ceramics Journey</h1>
                <p>In the fall of 2023, I signed up for my first ceramics class. (Well, technically I began working with clay as a ten year old at summer camp. I made one pinch pot that summer, and that was the extent of my early career.) </p>
                <p>For the first few months of ceramics class, I struggled with each step of the process: wedging (aka kneading) the clay, centering the mound on the wheel, "pulling up" the sides, trimming the partially dried vessel, and - finally - applying the glaze. </p>
                <p> My progress has been far from linear, but in general I've come a long way. What started out as a once-a-week hobby has blossomed into a full-blown obsession. If I don't get to the studio a few times a week, I viscerally feel the loss.
                </p>

                    <p> I'd initially assumed mastering the wheel was
